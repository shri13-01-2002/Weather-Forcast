HTML-It is the standard markup language for creating web pages also known as (HyperText Markup Language).
    -It is used to structure content on the web, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms.

Structure of html
-<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Document Title</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
-An element includes a start tag, content, and end tag.

meta tag-The <meta> tag provides metadata about the HTML document.
        -such as character set, description, keywords, and viewport settings for responsive design.
<b>-Bold text without any semantic meaning.
<i>-Italic text without any semantic meaning.
<em>-Emphasized text that conveys importance, typically rendered in italics.

Block-level elements (e.g., <div>, <p>)
-Occupy the full width of their container by default, regardless of their content.
-Start on a new line (i.e. break the line).
-You can set width, height, margins, and padding.
-Often used as containers or structural elements.

Inline elements (e.g., <span>, <a>) 
-Only take up as much width as their content requires.
-Do not start on a new line.
-Respect the flow of surrounding content.
-Cannot set width and height directly (unless you convert them to block or inline-block).

Semantic tags-It clearly describe the purpose of the HTML element, both to browsers and developers.
<header>-Introductory content or navigational links at the top
<nav>-Contains navigation links
<section>-A thematic grouping of content (like chapters or tabs)
<article>-A self-contained piece of content (like a blog post)
<aside>-Related side content (like a sidebar or ad)
<footer>-Footer of a document or section
<main>-The main content area, unique to the page
<figure> / <figcaption>-Multimedia content with captions

Form tag creation-
html
<form>
  <input type="text">
  <input type="submit">
</form>

<div>(Non Sementic)
-The <div> element is a generic container with no inherent meaning.
-It's commonly used for layout purposes or when no other semantic tag fits.
-Requires class or id attributes to give it context.

<section> – Semantic
-Represents a thematic grouping of related content.
-Usually has a heading (<h1>–<h6>) and forms a logical block within the document.
-Clearly communicates the content’s purpose to browsers, assistive technologies, and search engines.

Tabel creation
-Using <table>, <tr>, <td>, <th>:
-html
<table>
  <tr><th>Name</th><th>Age</th></tr>
  <tr><td>John</td><td>25</td></tr>
</table>

Formatting Tags
-These tags are used to style or emphasize parts of the content in an HTML document.
<b>-Makes text bold (no extra importance)<b>Bold Text</b>
<strong>-Strong importance (bold + semantic meaning)<strong>Important</strong>
<i>-Italic text (no emphasis)<i>Italic Text</i>
<em>-Emphasized text (italic+semantic emphasis)	<em>Important Text</em>
<u>-Underlines text <u>Underlined</u>
<mark>-Highlights text with yellow background	<mark>Highlighted</mark>
<small>-Displays smaller text <small>Fine print</small>

Ordered List
-Displays items in a specific sequence (numbered or alphabetically)
-Each item is wrapped in an <li> (list item).
-<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven</li>
  <li>Mix ingredients</li>
  <li>Bake for 20 minutes</li>
</ol>

<ul> — Unordered List
-Displays items without a particular order
-Uses bullets (●) by default
-<ul>
  <li>Apples</li>
  <li>Bananas</li>
  <li>Oranges</li>
</ul>

CSS-(Cascading Style Sheets)
   -It is used to style and layout web pages. 
   -It allows you to control the visual appearance of HTML elements, such as color, font, spacing, alignment, and positioning.

Way To add CSS
-Inline css-Styles applied directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute.
 	   - Good for quick styling of individual elements or for one-off styles.
	   -Cannot be reused.
Syt-<p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">This is a red, larger text.</p>

-Internal CSS(Using <style> Tag)-Styles are defined inside the <style> tag, which is placed within the <head> section of your HTML document.
				-Useful when you have a small website or want to style a single page without creating an external CSS file.
				-Doesn't provide the same reusability as external CSS for multiple pages.
Syt-
<style>
    body {
      background-color: #f4f4f4;
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    }
    p {
      color: blue;
      font-size: 16px;
    }
  </style>
-External CSS (Using <link> Tag)-CSS is written in an external file (e.g., style.css) and linked to the HTML document using the <link> tag in the <head> section.
				-This is the most efficient method for styling large websites or multiple pages because it allows you to apply the same CSS styles across multiple HTML files.
				-Styles are separate from content, which keeps the HTML file cleaner and easier to maintain. One CSS file can style multiple pages.
				-New file is created name style.css in which 

selector-Selectors allow you to target specific elements in your HTML document. 
-universal-Selects all elements on the page.
-type-Selects all elements of a specific type (e.g., <h1>, <p>, <div>).
-class-Selects all elements with a specific class attribute.
-Id-Selects a single element with a specific ID attribute.
-Attributes-Selects elements with a specific attribute.

Properties-It define how an element should be styled.
-Color and Background-Sets the text color where as background Sets the background color of an element.
-Font and Text-
-Text Alignment-Aligns the text horizontally (left, center, right, justify).
-Box model-(Padding, Margin, Border)
-Positioning-Defines how an element is positioned top, right, bottom, left: Determines the positioning of an element.

BOx Model-describes how every HTML element is wrapped in a rectangular box that consists of the following model.
-Content-The actual text, image, or other content inside the element.
-Padding-Space inside the element, between the content and the border.
-Border-The edge around the padding (can be solid, dashed, etc.).
-Margin-Space outside the element, between it and neighboring elements.
syt-.box {                                   default
  width: 200px;                              -*{
  padding: 20px;                                box-sizing: border-box;
